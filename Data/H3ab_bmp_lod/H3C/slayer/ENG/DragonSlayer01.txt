Intro
Message:
Your mother has been training Dragon Slayers for as long as she can remember. It is now time that she train her only son. Your mother knows how smart you are and therefore she can't give you any ordinary task.  Approximately 30 or so years ago your mother went to the Festival of Life. The events of the festival inspired her.  She took red crystal and, with the idea of a Golem in her head, created Crystal Dragons.  She then set them loose in this little valley.  The only thing going for you is your ability to train priests and mages into enchanters.  You have control of a small village.   Your task is to kill the Crystal Dragons with the troops given to you so you can prove to your mother and to everyone else you are ready to be a Dragon Slayer.  The task is great so be careful.

On your way to the Black Market you stumble across a camp. As you approach,  you notice that the people in the camp aren't friendly.  Realizing only too late you aren't welcome anywhere near their camp, you look around to see that you are surrounded.  Not wanting to fight you bribe your way out.

Lying on the ground are small cracked shards of red crystal.   Recognizing the shards you figure the Crystal Dragons must not have been pleased that their minions failed to stop you.  Smirking to yourself, your confidence grows.  You are ready for this...so you tell yourself.
