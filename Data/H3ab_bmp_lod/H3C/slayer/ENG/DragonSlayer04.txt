No Magic
Message:
As you walk around  you notice that the towns around the base of the mountains are very primitive.  They have no mage guilds what-so-ever.  It is then that you realize that you must use your magic wisely, for you have no way of recharging your mana.

After several days up the mountain your army is getting restless.  There have been many hard battles, and many people have died. Your army's morale has been good up until now. Now they are starting to fear. The upcoming battle might be too much for them.  After some rest, they agree to go on.

You and your army have made it this far.  Morale has not been good, but your army has a newly found confidence.  On the ground are deep blue scales coated in blood.  "If it can bleed, then it can die" you think to yourself, knowing everyone else must be thinking the same thing.

Message:
Your army has broken up the scales and split them between themselves.  They now wear the scale pieces on their necks and on their armor as good luck.  Everyone is still scared, but knowing something that is said to be unbeatable can be killed has brought morale up.
