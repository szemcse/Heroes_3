Tark was watching the pirates load their army and resources onto their ships, but he was preoccupied about his people. They had kept their existence a secret from the rest of the world for many years, but many of them were either dead or imprisoned now.	“Tark, will you follow us, or do you have other plans? We are grateful for your help and help of your people...” Bidley started.	“It is I who should be grateful,” Tark interrupted. “You showed me that there is life beyond my kingdom. The only thing left to do is to set my people free. I know where they are,” the reptile leader continued.	“Perhaps we could help?” Bidley offered.	“No. You have one path ahead of you, and I have another. I have to save my people. Don't assume that all the nix you meet will know of you or help you. There are just as many scoundrels among the nix as among men,” replied Tark, turning toward the sea.	“Will we meet again?” asked Bidley.	“Probably,” the nix replied. “If I return, I'll come find you. If not...forget about me.” With that, Tark walked into the water until it reached his waist, then dived and disappeared from view.

Tark swam for a long time until he reached the subterranean kindom of the warlock lords. A small colony of nix, independent from the island kingdom where Tark ruled, had lived in these underwater caverns until the warlocks conquered and enslaved them. It was time to free those nix, and also to show them who their true ruler was. Tark was the last of an ancient line of nix kings. Something terrible had happened to their race: as a result of some mysterious disease, many of their eggs now turned out to be empty. As a result, the population had slowly dwindled, and the once flourishing people had been reduced to a mere handful of nix on one small island and the surrounding waters. 	Though to the casual eye he seemed like a slow-moving and slow-thinking reptile, Tark absorbed information quickly. He knew that the lords of Nighon were in the throes of a civil war right now. If he were to invade their lands and take over one of their cities, they wouldn't notice immediately.

Tark knew that he couldn't save everyone, but perhaps he could save the majority. Those he is unable to rescue will have to flee and fend for themselves if they want to live. After interrogating the civilians of his newly-occupied city, Tark learned that the lords were busy fighting and wouldn't notice the loss of this city right away. Additionally, Tark found out that the captured nix are working in the caverns one level below the castle. The poisonous vapors of that level are deadly to minotaurs, humans, and troglodytes, but the nix hardly notice it. The warlocks particularly prize their nix slaves for this trait.

It's dark and stuffy in these caves. Tark has decided to find a new, better home for his people. Perhaps those pirates, widely-traveled as they are, will know of a quiet place to settle--somewhere the nix can put down roots and slowly restore their civilization without fear of invaders. For this reason, Tark has decided to join Bidley and his followers as soon as he has freed his enslaved kin.

Sooner or later, these lords will end their squabble and notice their lost outpost. It's important to be ready for their coming and to prepare a counterstrike they will be unable to recover from.

A nix lies dying in a distant camp. He has lost too much blood to live, but there is a way to save his life. 
Our efforts to save the dying nix remain unsuccessful.
With fresh blood infused into the dying creature, he will recover and may even be able to hold a weapon.

“I can't believe my eyes! You are the royal heir!”	“I am Prince Tark.”	“I bow before thee, prince. I escaped the poisonous mines on the lower level. When the Nighon war started, they loosened their control over the slaves. But why did you come, Prince Tark?” 	“My duty is to free as many of our kin as possible.”	“Then let me join you. I am an experienced warrior, and I have this armor I took from a slain minotaur. I am ready to give my life to rescue our people,” said the warrior, and knelt.
