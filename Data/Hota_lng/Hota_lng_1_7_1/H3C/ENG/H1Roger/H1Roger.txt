Pirates and Palms — Jolly Roger lobogó alatt A

Right-click text:
Caught in a shipwreck, the pirate Jeremy ended up on an island between Nighon and Eeofol. There is an abandoned Erathian fort here that must be captured and built up to a castle.

Prologue:
Licentious life of a pirate… Horizonless sea over, the creaking ship and the whishing salty wind! The young pirate Jeremy Albatross relishes it, until one day he finds himself at the death’s door. A doomed path it was or a chain of eventualities?		Desperately trying to lose the chase of Erathians, Jeremy leads Black Unicorn, his caravel, right into the heart of a storm. He put his trust in the fortune, and was in complete denial of the fact that these humongous, tempestuous waves may overturn the ship and send it into the Davy Jones' locker. However, the fortune smiled on Jeremy, though, not exactly in the way he would prefer. The ship cannoned into the rocks and got a massive hole. It was impossible to repair the damage; however the crew managed to haul Black Unicorn up to the nearest land and abandon it on the in-shore riffs.		At least, Jeremy Albatross is alive, as well as a good quarter of his crew and his faithful mate Patris. The golden beach of an unknown island, blue sky over their heads, and green sea, lasting up and beyond the horizon… A new adventure awaited them.

A Kreegan force from nearby Eeofol is about to land. The island must be taken under full control before this happens, and there is no time to spare.

Prologue:
Jeremy didn’t yet think of what awaits him in the future. He was simply enjoying his life now. However, somewhere far away on the continent, humongous hordes of Kreegan demons was beginning to stir. They were preparing for a final move, for an ultimate incarnation of their plan of destroying this world. Now, they were sending their scouts in all word’s corners. And as it turns out, this little island is in their way, with a fort standing in the middle, with Jolly Roger insidiously grinning from a black pirate flag.		In order to survive, Jeremy has to take over the island. Will he succeed this time?

The enemy is close, but the pirates are not on their own anymore. The locals are prepared to fend off the uninvited guests alongside them. The Kreegan attack on the island must be thwarted and their supply base captured.

Prologue:
The black ships have moored to the shore. Claws and hooves of terrible alien creatures have	stepped on the sands of the shore, to destroy all that is able to offer resistance. Jeremy and his new pal Alkin leaned over the map, trying to figure out how to defeat the Kreegan invasion. Will the militia consisting of islanders and bandits be able to provide a worthy resistance, or will they perish, booted in the mud?		Jeremy still trusts in his fortune. He is pinned down, and he has no other choice but to face the new enemy. He simply cannot afford to be defeated right now.

Epilogue:
The remains of the demonic army were pressed back and thrown to the sea. This was a victory most excellent commanders would be proud of: a handful of militia soldiers and savages made good execution of Kreegans. Such a pity that nobody will come to know about it.		Jeremy was standing with his men on a sea shore, in great rejoice. However, he was even happier due to the fact that the speedy, sturdy Kreegan ships were untouched. He immediately ordered to load the ships and cast off.		While already on board and looking at the dimming island, Jeremy remembered that he never asked Alkin about whom he really was and what he was doing on that island. However, he threw that out of his head immediately, because new adventures waited. Which, clearly, he was not aware of yet.
