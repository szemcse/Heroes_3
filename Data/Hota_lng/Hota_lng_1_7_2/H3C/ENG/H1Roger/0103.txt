Day 1
Message:
With the swashbucklers and the locals united, our army marched to the eastern side of the island. We had just enough resources and men to erect a new fortress of our own.	“You've done well, Jeremy Gull,” Alkin praised me. 	“Albatross. It's Albatross,” I corrected indignantly. “What's our next course of action?”	“My tribe has a settlement to the east. I wasn't catching fleas all this time, you know—the fortifications are up. Yours are surely not as good as mine, but then again, you haven't served in the Tatalian army,” Alkin said teasingly.	“That's very impressive, but I have firearms instead of flails and bows,” I shot back, conspicuously revealing my pistol in its holster. 	“All right, all right. Come back when you're out of powder and this thing is of less use than a decent club. Anyway... we'll need all the weapons we can get,” he snapped irritably. 	“My scouts have informed me that two Kreegan armies have landed on the northern shore. Luckily, they will have a difficult time advancing through the swamp. In fact, they'll be a perfect target for ambushes and sudden strikes,” I surmised.	“True, but they most certainly have reinforcements elsewhere. And they must have a secret base for these reinforcements, no doubt about it—they'd be unable to proceed with their operations without one. I suggest we find this base and pillage it, if we intend to eliminate a recurring threat. But first things first, as you've mentioned, we need to deal with the immediate threat of these enemy armies on the island. Do you agree with that plan, my esteemed ally?” Alkin asked, offering me his hand... or paw? I have no idea what they call their limbs.	I shook this appendage, though it felt odd to shake the hand of someone who wasn't human. “Good,” Alkin nodded. “I'll be returning to my army, and we'll try to reinforce the settlement a bit more. The biggest thing now is to prevent the Kreegans from gathering enough creatures to capture either your fortress or mine. If that happens, it will be the beginning of the end.”

Day 2
Message:
Our new fort stood ready, yet there was no time to stand idle. There were Kreegans all over the island. We'd have to prevent them from reaching their stashes, where they had goods stowed away by scouts.	“Patris!” I called my mate.	“Aye, Cap'n?” 	“We need to find and pillage the demons' stashes. Can you handle that?” 	“I'm afraid I wouldn't know where to start with the portals and whatnot,” Patris said, his brow furrowed. 	“That's okay. Just take a few good men and ambush a Kreegan caravan. If you're lucky, that'll lead you to their hideouts.” 	“Ah, yes indeed Cap'n, I have a flair for that kind of thing!” Patris's face lit up. “I'll begin the preparations right away. I'll take Diego and Erik with me; those guys are sharper and braver than most.”	“That's what I like to hear!”

Name:
Day 7
Message:
Patris's guerilla activity has proven fruitful. He's managed to rob some Kreegan caravans and has sent the resources to our fortress.

Name:
Day 9
Message:
A note from Alkin arrives:	“I suspect that the demons' secret base is underground. Every week, hordes of imps emerge from below. They will swarm the island if not stopped. As originally planned, we must continue to focus on defeating the nearby Kreegan armies, and then we must locate their base. My scouts report that they have even brought several devils—those elite Kreegan beasts. Even your blasting powder toy won't save you from those, so be careful, buddy.”

Name:
Day 15
Message:
Patris reports that he has located and pillaged a demon stash hidden deep in the jungle. Outstanding work! I keep wondering who he was before he became a pirate. 

Name:
Day 32
Message:
We've been fending off the Kreegans for over a month now. They must not have expected such fierce and organized resistance from savages. Regardless, the hordes of imps continue to advance without any sign of abating. Lately, I've been curious about Alkin. What is a Tatalian sergeant doing on this godforsaken island? I certainly have to ask—perhaps once this war is over.

Message:
An old goblin lives here. He claims that he was once a mighty warrior with fierce attack skills. Recently, his beloved wolf was killed by demons, and he is too frail to avenge her. He offers to pass on everything he knows if we slay the demons for him.
The goblin refuses to speak until his wolf is avenged.
The demons now slain, the old goblin looks elated as he offers to share his knowledge of combat.

A great troll stands before us.		“Hey yous. The pass is no free. Yes, pay now, ten times hundred coins!” he demands, folding his gnarled fingers into a fist. 	“How about one times a sabre between your eyes?” I asked. 	“Hehe!” the troll grinned. “You can do dat. But we is clever. I here, brothers under bridge. If me dying, brothers explode big barrel, and you die with bridge!” 	“You fat racketeer,” I spit, reluctantly handing over the money.

The base is surrounded by a forcefield. It looks like the staff from one of the Kreegan warchiefs is needed to pass through it.
There is no other way to remove the barrier.
We have the staff! We may remove a layer of the forcefield now.
