Prisoner of Doom — Tengerek terrorizációja A

Right-click text:
Bidley is about to break a mysterious prisoner out of an anti-magic prison in Krewlod. He lacks the manpower to do it yet, so he must enlist the help of local barbarians.

Prologue:
In the bards' legends, almost everything starts with a hero sitting in a tavern. Bidley the pirate was doing just the same. The place located in a fishing town on a shore of a barbaric Krewlod.		Who knew that a gossip with a drunkard will turn into a great adventure that will change the world? Nobody, of course. And definitely not Bidley. He was sitting and drinking cheap beer, listening to an old pirate tale about a prisoner who was said to be kept in a magical prison. Bidley thought that it was probably some powerful mage, probably from Bracada. He also thought that the generosity of such prisoner should be, well, generous.		Unfortunately, Bidley was not aware of the existence of Xanthor, the well-known mage. Xanthor was not fond of pirates at all. The fate, however, sent Bidley to rescue his old nemesis. And this was the beginning...


Evenmorn — Tengerek terrorizációja B

Right-click text:
Jeremy and Casmetra must protect the magical library on Evenmorn Island from the overwhelming forces of necromancers and their mercenaries.

Prologue:
A quick glance, a misplaced word, a reckless decision… All these things can change our life radically. Through taking the decision to help the woman, Jeremy has changed his and his brother's life dramatically. It is hard to predict who will be our friend, and who will be our foe. It is as hard as to predict the moments when our life will change.  Jeremy stepped on this thin ice since his war with the demons on the small island. So far, he assumed the events around him to be resolved by his luck.


The Shores of Hell — Tengerek terrorizációja C

Right-click text:
Bidley and his brother are preparing to set sail for the Horn of the Abyss, but their coffers are not full enough to equip a proper fleet. Rumor has it that the Kreegans on the coast of Eeofol have the components of the Cornucopia. 

Prologue:
Bidley got to know about the Horn of the Abyss after saving Xanthor. In reality, Xanthor told him about it in hope that the pirate will vanish, trying to acquire it.  Bidley will never know this, however.		Now, reunited with the brother, they started plotting the march for the Horn of the Abyss with all seriousness. They needed ships, many ships, men and supplies as well. Where to get all of that from? Casmetra offered to explore the Hell Shore, and raid the Kreegan lands. A dangerous venture, but a promising one.


The Freedom of the Nix — Tengerek terrorizációja D

Right-click text:
Tark, the Prince of the Nix, heads over to the dungeons of Nighon to free his brethren from the yoke of warlocks.

Prologue:
What to do, when the whole race's fate depends on you? Nix Tark knew what to do in this case. While not being completely sure that his people will restore the former glory of their kingdom, he was ready to do his best to save them. His way lied through the depths of the Nighon caves. He reached the grim lands of the warlocks, cruel lords and underground monsters. Tark was ready to sacrifice himself in order to save nix from slavery and give them freedom.


In Search of the Horn — Tengerek terrorizációja E

Right-click text:
Bidley, Casmetra and Jeremy have arrived at the island of the Vengeful Serpent. The dungeons under the island are the alleged location of the legendary Horn of the Abyss.

Prologue:
And here it is, the moment of doom! Bidley, Casmetra and Jeremy arrived at the place where the Horn of the Abyss was kept. Will they be able to retrieve it? Did they know what awaited them? Of course not. Especially Bidley, with all the trouble he had to go through. He feared nothing with brother at his side, however.	However, they should be alert about things going not as smoothly as they predicted in the beginning of the adventure…


Treachery — Tengerek terrorizációja F

Right-click text:
The mage Dargem betrayed Bidley and took the Horn of the Abyss for himself. While Jeremy is trying to track down the traitor, the Tatalians are itching to take revenge on the pirates for their recent defeat. 	

Prologue:
As soon as Bidley, after all his dungeon adventures reached for the Horn, the voice behind yelled:	'Unbelievable! It is mine, finally!'		After that, Bidley's new partner Dargem landed a blow at his head, and grabbed the artifact. The walls of the ancient vault started to shake, and the altar rose up, forming an island. The traitor grabbed the Horn, but did not figure out how to use it.  Dargem summoned a boat and jumped in rapidly, taking the unconscious Bidley with him.		Jeremy and Casmetra saw the birth of a new island. They also saw how Dargem sail away, and great sea serpents emerge from the depths after him. Jeremy did not know what was going on, but he was sure that his brother is in trouble.

Epilogue:
The defenders of the Regnan fortress have shivered, and Casmetra and Jeremy hurried in. Dargem left the captive be and grabbed the Horn. He ran to the highest tower. While Jeremy was helping his brother to untie the ropes, Casmetra yelled powerfully:	'Give the Horn back! Immediately!'	With a scared face, Dargem yelled back:	'Never! You betrayed me, and left me alone! Now I know what to do!'		Taking the artifact in both hands, Dargem was just about to blow the Horn, when with a piercing 'STOP!!!' Casmetra threw a magical spell at him. A huge magical explosion followed, and the shock wave destroyed half of a fortress, creating something like a whirlpool underneath it.		The only thing that Jeremy remembered was how he tried to get to higher ground desperately, and how Casmetra yelled:	'Idiot! We will be dragged into another Plane of existence because of you!'		Hours, or maybe weeks after that, Jeremy found himself on a sea shore. Where is Bidley? And what happened to the Horn? May this be the end of the legend about the Horn of the Abyss?
