Dargem's diary. Entry 301		"We had a long journey ahead of us. I would never have imagined a nameless archipelago off the coast of Tatalia to be the location of a legendary artifact—but Lady Casmetra stated with full confidence that it should be out there. She gave me all the instructions I might need and promised to keep an eye on my progress.		At first, I suspected Casmetra of plotting against me... however, the swampy shores of Tatalia on the horizon suggested that my employer was going to distract the lizardmen so that I could complete my mission unhindered. I shared my thoughts with Casmetra; she just smiled and assured me that my takeaway was absolutely correct."

Dargem's diary. Entry 302		"Our paths diverged: the sorceress' fleet sailed for the coast of Tatalia, while my own ships headed towards a mysterious archipelago I had never seen on any map. It must have been deliberately kept a secret from the curious eye, and therefore I reckon that information about it was somehow removed from the cartographers' archives—but i cannot even begin to imagine who could possess the means to provide for that. Suddenly, I felt a gust of icy wind... it was as if a storm had gathered within a split second!  		We had a rough time, but the situation remained under control. We were, however, forced to make a sharp turn that took us far away from the other two ships with my men. Our own ship had taken heavy damage, so we had to immediately moor at the first island we sailed by. What a shame! I can only hope that our other parties will land on the same island, and we will be able to join forces.		I went down to the sandy beach at the head of a small group of mercenaries and looked bitterly at the ship. It's going to need extensive repairs! I didn't want to think about it now, though. I was burning with impatience—I was about to unravel the scroll Casmetra had given me, instructing me to only read it after getting close to the target. The yellowed parchment bore a map of the dungeon that apparently contained the Horn of the Abyss. By the looks of it, the map was charted a very long time ago. We took a great deal of papers and scrolls from the necromancers' library, but I couldn't remember this one. However, back then, I didn't really have time to study the loot in earnest. I was confused by the fact that the map bore next to no markings, except for a couple of obscure icons with captions: "The Horn should be here" and "Guardian!!!" Some magic words were also written here; they were supposed to be uttered in order to dispel some illusions. Unfortunately, the illusions weren't marked on the map either—I had to take my chances. 		I tucked the map into my belt and sighed. We will have to defeat the Guardian. This will be the first step in... in MY quest for the Horn of the Abyss!"

Dargem's diary. Entry 303		"Casmetra and her witches promised that they would be able to distract the Tatalians from my endeavors, but that's unlikely to last for longer than three months. My employer's powers aren't limitless, although I must admit that she had made quite the first impression on me... Well, what can you expect from a craven sorceress from Noraston? That she would bring an army of elves and unicorns? I mean... I was tormented for a while by doubts about her identity, but at this point, it doesn't matter at all.		I wish I could have persuaded Gunnar to stay with us, but the horned hulk was too scared to displease his Nighonian masters. The Minotaur and his goons would be a great help now that I have to defeat the Guardian, whoever it is. 		It must be said that things are not so straightforward here! As Casmetra had stated, to get to the Guardian, one has to find the keys. And what might they be? I don't know. The only thing we are confident about is that the keys are somewhere in this archipelago as well. Time to get off the island and start searching."

Dargem's diary. Entry 304		"I had a thought: it's worth being thrifty with magic here. I need to shake the habit of unleashing powerful spells for the slightest reason, as I used to do. I don't know when or where I'll be able to find a source to recharge my magic reserves—and if I'm caught with them depleted at a bad moment, my expedition will end much sooner than I'd like."

Dargem's diary. Entry 306		"I've spent the longest time thinking about who this Guardian could be. Then, the answer came to me, like a revelation. This is undoubtedly an Azure Dragon. Maybe even more than one. Sometimes, these creatures are also called "ice dragons", although they have little in common with ice, or with any other element. They are astoundingly huge, ferocious and ancient. No one really knows if they came to be naturally, or if they were the work of some forerunner of Agar from before the Silence. Unlike the innately docile, or at least controllable, creatures that warlocks create with magic and alchemy, azure dragons are exceptionally intelligent and willful. Fortunately, they are quite rare, and besides, some knights and mages consider it their duty to slay at least one such creature, just to put a feather in their hat. Here's a good time to point out that the hunters killed these endeavors greatly outnumber the actual slayed dragons—but there is never a shortage of new madmen. The reputation gained by these Azure Dragons is thus peculiar, so they prefer to settle in places forgotten by the gods; sometimes, without meaning to, they also become guardians of ancient artifacts and other valuable things, just by way of making themselves a lair near one. If you manage to come across a dungeon where no human has set foot in a couple centuries, then there almost certainly is a monster of that kind waiting for you inside."

Durham's diary. Entry 310		"A message came from this... Casmetra. She reproaches me for progressing slowly and sparingly describes her first encounter with the Tatalians. I'm only mildly annoyed by her grievances. Very soon, everyone will be talking about Dargem; I will become one of the most famous mages and collectors of our time. Does this fool really think I'll just yield the Horn to her?"

Durham's diary. Entry 312		"I saw flashes of lightning on the horizon. This isn't just a distant storm—these are traces of a magical battle. Most likely, Casmetra had come to blows with the Tatalians again. It pleases me to know she's toiling in vain, and it's a special pleasure to imagine her face contorted with anger, but that's no reason to be tardy. It's time to resolutely muster our strength and fight our way into the dungeon."

Dargem's diary. Entry 320		"The locals at the archipelago confuse me. From what I've seen and heard, counting the fools who come after the Horn of the Abyss seems to be a source of amusement here. I was even told that bets are being placed. Isn't that odd? I've worked my tail off to get information about this place! It felt like very few people should even know of it! So what was that all about? I spent months stomping around stinking, deadly holes just so some pompous wench could make sure I really was as good as my reputation? Maybe Casmetra had even sent someone here before. And she withheld the critical information of my predecessors' fates from me! Now that she's got me involved, it's not hard to imagine how things went for them... Doesn't matter anymore. Dargem Llywellyn will prove his worth. Even if the witch seeks to swindle me, I will definitely outsmart her."

Entry from Dargem's diary:		"Am I losing the plot? It feels like a straight-up open house here, rather than a place where one of the greatest artifacts in the world's history is kept in strict secret. I've just heard from the locals that Black Balfour has been stomping around these parts for several weeks now. He is undoubtedly an eminent pirate, but certainly not a connoisseur of rarities; to be honest, he is an uncouth and all-around nasty character. What wind brought him here? And why now? Did that snake Casmetra lure him here too, looking to make sure I wouldn't leave here in one piece and carrying the Horn with me?! Well, this bastard should try me! I'll give him such thorough lightning bolt treatment, he'll turn black as a firebrand and finally earn his moniker in full!		Once I've dealt with him, I'll find Casmetra... First, I'm going to rip that stupid glove off her hand—was it meant to astound me, or something?! I'm not a five-years-old; glowing eyes and iron claws don't scare me. Then I'll blow the magic plaster off her face and see how old she really is—for one can't possibly amass such a wealth of treachery and meanness in one's soul over a single lifetime. And then... Then I'll probably get bored of messing with the worthless old hag; by then, I'll have the Horn of the Abyss in my hands! I guess I'll just let her go... and watch her fly down, because she'll be going straight off the balcony of that cursed tower of hers that looks so much like a goblin's club.		Horn of the Abyss! I will not allow you to be tainted by the paws of bloodthirsty halfwits and presumptuous fortune-tellers. You will be mine, mine!"

Dargem's diary. Entry 322		"Today, a ship approached dangerously close to the archipelago. No idea whether it was a Tatalian or Erathian one. I couldn't see the flag. Maybe just a privateer. Once again, I'm reminded there's no time to lose. If hordes of lizardmen riding on basiliskback land here, my only option will be running away. Should this battle happen, I won't have any allies on my side, even dubious ones like Kilgor and his horde."

Dargem's diary. Entry 333		"Today I felt the ominous wind blowing again, just like during the storm that very nearly made my expedition keel over! I started sweating bullets and shivering. 		It felt as though the sky itself was laughing ominously... and my guesses were confirmed. The Dead God is the old mate of mine, Boyd. The thief and rascal who plotted against me! Last time we met, I just walked away—but I should have tracked this walking carrion down and burned it with lightning! 		I raised my head to the sky and exclaimed, "Hey, bone face! Let's meet and sort things out like men—even if all things masculine you've ever had have long rotted away! I've killed my share of powerful mages, warriors, and dragons; and I'll gladly kill a mindless dead clown a second time over if I must! Neither you, nor the dragons, nor anything else will stand in my way when I go to take the Horn of the Abyss!" 		A sailor tapped me on the shoulder and asked if I was all right. I was taken aback and even dropped my hat. The sailor immediately picked it up and shoved it into my hands. I grinned and declared that very soon, we would be sending an old rotten scarecrow who overstayed his welcome in this world to the bottom of the sea! My crew met this announcement with an eager cheer."

Had Gunnar been here with them, he would surely have handled those senseless creatures... Hell, even that dimwit Gruezak would've done some good! He'd suggest they eat the Guardian's carcass together, and the savages would've happily joined our cause! Instead, our forces have grown three times smaller now. I ordered a search of the wreckage... well, of the corpses, too. Maybe there's something valuable to be found on them—I mean, the lads don't need it anymore."

Such a creature appearing suddenly before them might well have caused the mercenaries to run for the hills."

Entry from Dargem's diary:		"While exploring the island, we came across a thatched hut. I drew my cutlass and readied my ice beam, just in case someone jumps us—every other creature we meen on this damn island is trying to eat us! 		My fears were unfounded. A decrepit, harmless-looking orc shaman came out of the hut, cast a purbling gaze at us, and croaked:	"I know why you're here, umie. You want to get into the Dungeon of the Vengeful Serpent. 	"I sure hope 'umie' isn't an insult, or I'll freeze your empty head and crack it open like a rotten pumpkin," I said. 	"Lay a finger on me, umie, and you'll never know what it takes to get where you want to get!"		I thought the argument reasonable, so I deactivated the spell and put my cutlass away. A surprisingly thorough conversation took place between us, and I learned I would have to find eight pendants to enter the Guardian's dungeon. Six of them are hidden in different parts of the island, and I need to be very careful to avoid missing them. One is kept by a local pirate, and another is in the possession of some "dead god." I didn't like the last one at all! When I asked the shaman what that "dead god" was, he just cackled ominously. Then he invited me to enter the hut, where he could show me the location of some of the pendants in his magic cauldron."

I think I've got what the pilgrims need. Give up the rings?

Some kind of magic barrier again... After studying it, I came to the conclusion I should be able to dispel it with an artifact like the Orb of Inhibition.
I don't think I can do anything without the Orb.
Barriers are no barrier to Dargem Llywellyn! I held the Orb of Inhibition up to the magic wall, and it trembled. Destroy it?

Entry from Dargem's diary: "Per Casmetra's instructions, this is the island. It is surrounded by very rough waters, and the depth increases sharply just a few cubits from the shore, but for some reason the waves have not washed away the sand covering it... I studied the surface of the island carefully and realized that the breath of Azure Dragons has a peculiar effect on the environment: it causes any matter to crystallize. This is not sand, but salt! It seems that the surrounding waters are gradually turning into it; new grains are sticking to the mass, and the island is slowly growing. What monstrous power such a transformation should take! However, it should be much easier to turn the human body into a crystal; it contains much more matter that is already solid. I imagined the process of getting turned into a pillar of salt. I shuddered."

Entry from Dargem's diary: "There were piles of ice salt on the ground—the remains of my predecessors. I could feel the Azure Dragons' breath. The creatures were waiting for me in the darkness of the cave. I must... I must defeat them! This is something worth living for! The goal of my entire existence is the Horn of the Abyss! Now I know what I'd been working towards all these years. What I fought fate for. There is no more fear, only determination. Inside this cave lies the answer to all questions, the reward for everything I have endured along the way. I'm about to get what I deserve. One more step..."
