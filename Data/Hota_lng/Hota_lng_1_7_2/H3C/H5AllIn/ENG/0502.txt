Dargem's diary. Entry 250.		"This was probably the day after which I began to loathe myself even worse than after my ill-fated theft of the Helmet. 		It all started with Stella meeting me at the pre-agreed place, handing me a bag of ducats and saying:		"Excellent work, Mister Dargem! My masters are pleased with your success."		"Glad to hear it, my lady," I nodded politely. "And now, I would like to hear more about the expedition you mentioned..."		"Nice of you to remember that," Stella smiled broadly. It seemed to me as though smiling was her professional skill. She had definitely mastered the art of answering any manner of a question with one. "If you still want to take part in the expedition, then there is one more task for you to do..."		"Wait a minute, good lady, we didn't agree on this!		"That much is true," she sighed. "You have the right to refuse. I must say, however, that this mission is extremely important to my masters. And likewise for you."		"How so?" I inquired, squinting and looking her in the eye.		"The young barbarian chieftain Kilgor," Stella said softly. "Perhaps you've already heard of him—an unsavory character through and through... He recently spread the word that he is in dire need of mercenaries. He tried to raid Bracada, but ended up getting trapped. Now he needs a hand to break out. And Kilgor is willing to pay anything to get help. Do you understand what I'm getting at?" The young woman's eyes flashed, and she turned to the sea.		"Hard not to. You want to help this savage out so that he will finance the expedition," I hazarded a guess.		"Correct, as always, Mister Dargem."

Dargem's diary. Entry 251.		"And so I agreed to become the captain of a unit that should help Kilgor get out of his predicament. Well! I hear he can't stand mercenaries, but things are going from bad to worse for him, and he hardly has any choice. My men and I will approach from the sea and land to support the forces defending Fort Wildblade, the barbarian chieftain's headquarters. He was generous enough to placed an auxiliary fort at my disposal and even sent me something like a "liaison officer"—a pig-faced folt with a nonsensical name that starts with "G". I think. This shambling mound of lard looks like a brigand through and through. Well, if anything, at least he can procure his own supplies for his rabble, even if by robbery.		The combined forces of Erathia and Bracada are advancing from the north. Our task is to contain them, and then to overturn and defeat them. Darn it, I'm a traveler, mage, and collector, not a warlord! I already tried this role once, and I didn't enjoy fighting regular troops at all.		Right now, my biggest concern is not so much the life of the filthy brute, Kilgor, but rather the prospect of letting down my employers. My reputation, which I had barely begun to revive, would be shattered forever, and, worse still, I would never find out about the expedition Stella's masters are planning. Well, how's that for an incentive to try and play Tarnum—or some other mythical military genius. I've acted on worse."

From an unsent letter by Gruezak:		"So far, I've managed to play this pirate like a fiddle. For the kind of "been there, seen it" adventurer figure he's trying to pull, he's surprisingly unobservant, or maybe just too arrogant to pay attention to things going on beyond the tip of his nose. I managed, for example, to convince him that the disassembled ballista I brought with me was actually parts of a mechanism designed to turn a whole Gorgon roast on a spit.		Uncle Bof, I am of the opinion that Dargem figuring out who I really am is not a risk to consider. I can act freely around him, while he is convinced I am plundering the neighborhood for provisions and any other goods that are not nailed down. And if it turns out that he is unreliable... I remember your lessons well enough, old man. No person, no problem."

The Erathians and the spellweavers took me by surprise; that much you know. I am confident in my power, but the enemies outnumber me, and they have vile magicks on their side! I therefore command you: render all possible assistance to my forces and make sure that the enemy's shock troops do not penetrate my fortress!		I know your type well; people like you have no honor. You hired blades will happily stab your employer in the back if someone gives you a better deal. We're both grown men, and we understand that, don't we? I'll have a caravan of gold and supplies sent out—to secure my rear, not because I really like you. Under other circumstances, I'd love to see what color your guts are. Good luck!"

If only this slop balloon, Gruezak, would be of use like that once in a while! Anyway, several enemy generals are preparing a strike at Fort Wildblade, right into the heart of the territory I have been deployed to defend. It is not yet known what kind of heroes they are, but there are at least two of them. The Bracadan wizards began work on an arcane ritual to magically transport those armies right under our arses!		Damn cowards! The only thing I know for sure is that they won't be able to bring all their generals here at once; they will send them one by one. After the first ritual, the mages will have to recharge their portal, and we will have about a month to prepare for a new strike."

Dargem's diary. Entry 257		"Sometimes I can't help but wonder; why does one's luck turn all the time? Fate can be capricious. It all started with that mouthy rat Boyd—he wanted to take my place, and it was clear as day, even to one with no eyes and half a brain. I put up with him for a long time, hoping he would come to his senses and quit scheming. Alas! I had to execute the half-wit as a show of force, so that no one would ever draw new plots against me.		And what do you think? He rose from the dead! I don't know who helped him—the mainland Jadame is an incredible mess, and literally anything can happen there. 		The vile rotten carcass teamed up with goblins, man-eating midgets and other abominations from the wastelands, and they managed to oust us from the continent. I could not tolerate such an affront. I decided to take on this repeat offender... and failed!		That stupid bonehead rejoiced. He buried me alive, assured that he was not only killing me, but also condemning me to terrible death throes. Ha! Hoping to scare a Nighon native with some earth over his head! Isn't that something! Mind you, I am not a simple pirate—I am a sorcerer of the air element, and of quite outstanding power at that. Extracting some air out of the soil for breathing, weakening my bonds with tiny, pin-sharp gusts of wind—all that is small change for me. And then, long hours of patient, diligent exercises in forcing the wind to blow away the sand, until, layer by layer, it goes away and frees my coffin. Tor Anwyn himself couldn't handle me, let alone a stupid pirate's even stupider corpse!		There were no brains left in that bone box at all—otherwise he could have come up with a better idea than the execution, which I myself forced into his mind, begging him not to dispense the reckoning with the same measure that I once dispensed my punishment to him with. They say the Bracadans have come up with a whole science about the turns a person's thought takes—I think they call it psychology. Maybe I should write a textbook on the subject for them.		Well, dear diary, I have literally risen from the grave, and before long, I will regain my power... Very soon."

Well, our ancient cult of feasting is indeed very easy to mistake for a mixture of gluttony and sloppiness, if you have never been invited to sit at our table or taught the meaning behind every tradition-laden component of our ceremonial regales. This fop Dargem pulls unimaginable faces, as soon as his eye catches us, with all the required rituals of respect, skin and butcher our kill, applying patterns of hot blood to our faces; the seniors among us have first choice of the most valuable cuts and intestines which irrevocably lose their delicate taste as soon as the living warmth leaves them. Well, let him be content with his thrice moldy cheese and wines forgotten in a dusty basement since time before gods.		Old Preudhum would have the time of his life watching this gourmet! Now that was a man who knew his high cuisine: he could slice a fresh spleen into paper-thick slices, roast and serve it while the one who supplied it was still breathing. I remember, Bof, how you brought me to meet him and told me to learn everything he knows. I remember the way you uttered that word, "everything." I was a diligent student, Uncle Bof.		Someday I'll be asked, "Who were you in Kilgore's time, Gruezak?". That's probably how I'll answer: a cook. I just hope I won't be hearing these questions while drawn over a rack."

Dargem's diary. Entry 260		"A woman on a ship is trouble; that's what Erathian sailors think. This is actually the case, and it's quite understandable. On a long voyage, the male crew will sooner or later get at each other's throats if one of them enjoys female company, while the others do not. For this very reason, the pirates never even take women captive—they just throw them overboard.		However, most of the female population of Regna can hardly be characterized as timid housewives. Some female pirates have become legends of no smaller caliber as the best male captains. Of course, few girls in Regna have the guts to become regular sailors—this is a difficult and taxing job, fraught with constant risk. There is a stratum of Priestesses of the Sea in this society—they are considered full-fledged crew members, but no one forces them to scrub the deck or stretch the sails.		They can hardly be called cultists, although they observe rituals originating from the religion of some small people once assimilated by pirates. Rather, they are battle mages, supporting the crew with simple but effective spells. Male pirates largely perceive them as comrades-in-arms; but that's before going ashore, of course. It is worth noting, however, that some of these priestesses are very talented spellweavers of no smaller power than, say, druids. They command great influence and maintain close ties with the most reputable captains and admirals."

Also important is the fact that they prefer to live in salt water; they actually tend to spend more time in the depths than on land. Maybe the two species are related to an extent, but hardly greater than, say, goblins and ogres. The Nix once engaged in piracy, attacking ships and coercing tribute out of coastal settlements. This barbaric lifestyle, as well as constant internecine wars, brought the Nix to the verge of extinction.		They were scattered all over the world, and many ended up being enslaved. I've known these creatures since I lived in Nighon. We often used Nix laborers to work in flooded mines. Recently, however, they have managed to forget their old feuds and have reached out to the pirates of Regna. That was a wise decision: it gave their race powerful patrons.		An adult Nix is no weaker than an ogre or a troll, and armed with his weapon of choice, trident, he becomes a veritable death machine. For this reason, Regnan captains respect and value these creatures highly, and Nix can often be found at the forefront of their hosts."

From an unsent letter by Gruezak:		"Bof, I'll just pretend I never received your last letter with instructions. Don't forget: I have a lot of interesting things to share, should someone be willing to listen. For one, there's a captivating story about how Kilgore circumvented Boragus's law on the size of clan leaders' life guard by designating his extra men as kitchen staff on the registers submitted to the Duke. About the person who put the very idea of such a trick into his oaken head. About how Bo... the very mastermind personally recruited these "knife and brazier workers", and about what he taught them. What... recipes. About the exquisite treats the chieftains who abhorred Kilgore's rise would receive from this kitchen.		Of course, now, right after yours... our lord has proved his right to power in the only way worthy of a barbarian—by force, that is—this information is useless. But what if the seed falls into fertile soil a few years from now, with the clans already weary of his rule? What if they find out what a rotten foundation underlies the shrine you and Kija are erecting around the figure of our brave ruler? Think about it, Bofmog. Think carefully before giving me ultimatums and forcing me to risk my skin. I don't care about Dargem. I will say more: not only was he disrespectful to me, he even dared to threaten me, and I would like him to pay for that—but you yourself taught me that in our line of work, one cannot give in to feelings.		It would be small challenge for me to make sure the hireling does not survive the last fight, and the reward Kilgor sent him... disappears, but I found signs that someone other than myself is keeping an eye on him a well. This is someone who already counts on the money and would definitely disapprove of your plans to ensure yourself a safety net through a little embezzlement, just in case something unforeseen and premature befalls our ruler. And I'm not prepared to pay with my life for your greed."

Dargem's diary. Entry 265		"It seems that the last enemy general is about to arrive here at the head of his army. The famous knight, Sir Mullich, decided to throw his gauntlet in this war. He is preparing to march here with a group of archangels. I must admit that this foe is our biggest threat thus far. Just how accomplished a warrior Sir Mullich is can be judged by the fact that he is no more allowed to ride in jousting tournaments, so that others would have a chance to shine. However, an all-out war is no tilt, and I am not bound by any rules here! That being said, we should make proper preparations; It's not worth taking risks when victory is so close and the enemy is about to falter. Perhaps I won't even have to pummel Mullich with my own hands—if I manage to distract his attention from Kilgore's headquarters, the time gained thus should be enough for reinforcements from Krewlod to arrive. Once they're here, the enemy coalition will have no choice but to retreat."

It seems that recently, pirates have developed a sensible but irksome custom of locking their houses. I guess Elmore lives here; I'll have to find him if I want to visit his place.
Only Elmore can open the door.
"Thank you for saving me, Dargem!" Elmore exclaimed and bowed dramatically, taking a knee.	"Enough of the honors! Let's go have a chat," I grumbled, not without a silent sigh. I must admit that I enjoyed receiving the honors, but I didn't want to overindulge myself in the company of Regnans. 
"I've had absolutely no luck lately! I keep getting locked up," Elmore said angrily.
Elmore will only talk to Dargem.
"Bad luck, huh?" I chuckled.	"It's probably that old business in the tomb! I got into one... everything must have been cursed there! Ever since, I keep getting caught by knights and demons... even some talking lobsters," Elmore sighed, and began rummaging through his trunk.	"Talking lobsters?" Where did you meet them?" 	"Never mind! They're unlikely to still be there!" The pirate waved me off. "You'd better try this!"	"And what's that?" I asked, looking at a bowl with a pestle. There was some green stuff in it. 	"Paste made from rare mountain berries. Barbarians eat it to get stronger. 	"Are you and Miriam conspiring? Both of you seem to have developed an alarming desire to put all sorts of disgusting things into your mouths..." I grumbled.		Reluctantly, I scooped up some of the paste with my finger. The smell was vile, as if someone had already eaten these berries once. I held my breath and licked my finger. A wave of warmth spread through my body, my vision sharpened, and my movements became smooth and precise. Should I finish the treat?
