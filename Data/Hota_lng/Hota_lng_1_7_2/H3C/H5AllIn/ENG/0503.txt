Dargem's diary. Entry 270		"That evening, I was standing on the pier of a harbor near Krewlod. Stella came to oversee the delivery of the reward from the barbarian chieftain.		"I'm not finding this funny anymore, my lady," I sighed, and gave way to a team of goblins dragging a chest full of silver.		"I understand your desperation," Stella said. "You would be in your right if you decided to terminate the contract. You have already done a lot for us, Mister Dargem.		"I think I just might," I said, relieved.		"Fine," the young woman beamed. "Then would you be so kind as to recommend me another mercenary who would be willing to go on an expedition to find the Horn of the Abyss?"		"That thing is a myth," I muttered, and turned away.		Stella waved her hand vaguely and was about to leave when some kind of an instinct struck me. "Are you saying that you believe the Horn of the Abyss exists?"		"My employers are serious people. They would never waste their energy and money on searching for something that is not there. We just need to make the final preparations. I am very sorry that you, my dear Mister Dargem, have decided to withdraw from the playing table..."		"No, wait," I said excitedly. "I haven't yet decided anything! So what do you need for the expedition?"		Stella looked me in the eye and straightened her hair. "No fewer than five caravels. Preferably built from elven pine, but the long ears won't trade with pirates... And if we resort to smuggler channels, our procurement will take forever, let alone cost way too much. How do we resolve this situation?"		"Dear lady, allow me to offer you a plan," I said carefully, shifting my weight from one foot to the other. "If the elves don't sell us the timber, we'll take it ourselves."		"A raid on AvLee?"  Stella inquired.		"Precisely," I said. "Trust me, you will get everything you need, and very soon."		"You must mean, 'we will'?" The woman narrowed her eyes.

Dargem's diary. Entry 271		"Landing on the shores of AvLee is something I'd done before. I was just beginning my career as a mercenary, serving under a character by the name of Ergon, a barbarian from somewhere in north Enroth. Probably not the best time for reminiscing about that. The bottom line is that the pointy ears are not quite as serious about protecting their shores as the forests. Must be a quirk of their psyche.		As soon as I set foot on dry land, I sent a quick-witted sailor to reconnoiter. He came beck with a report of an elven settlement right to the south, even with something resembling a fort. This is good news; we can settle down there for the duration of our timber harvesting operation."

Dargem's diary. Entry 273		"As I expected, the elves and their cronies weren't particularly keen on preventing us from settling in AvLee. I can intimidate and bribe the people here in the fort so they will serve me. All in all, the elves are not a very tightly-knit people; they only unite when there's some common threat looming. Their peculiar sense of inner freedom tends to play these tricks on them.		Now the main challenge was revealed: most of the sawmills here are controlled by druids and are not well-suited for mass harvesting of timber. Stella didn't allow me much time—her masters expect the goods in three months."

I'm not much of an archer, but allegedly, even someone as inexperienced as myself can pick up this bow and hit a squirrel square in the eye from several hundred paces away."

The occurrences of them coming to the surface are very, very rare... unless someone or something forces them to leave their tunnels."

Dargem's diary. Entry 277		"Finally all is clear. Today I received a message from Tor Anwyn himself. The scroll in an elegant screw-down case was dropped by a harpy flying over my camp. By gods, it's a delight to read a well-written letter from a smart person once in a while, even if the sender is an enemy. It's not often that I get to experience such pleasure these days! And what exquisite handwriting! The contents, however...		"Greetings, Dargem! It's been a long time since we last met, but according to the latest news, you're still alive. I was beginning to forget about you—it's veritable elysium here in Nighon, you know. However, your recent visit to Maramec has made me very sad! Whether you work for Mutare or just sell your talents to someone else is not the point. You chose your own destiny of being a thief and a traitor yourself. Now accept what is due to your kind. Punishment, that is. I have tracked your movements; very soon Gunnar and his minotaurs will be on your trail to send greetings from home. Dargem, you know that I am not a bloodthirsty or vindictive man, so I did not ask Gunnar for your head... however, your last act was too much, even for my patience. Good luck."		That's it! Tor wants me dead—though it feels as though he doesn't think much of his pet bull's abilities. Oh, why at such an inconvenient moment? On the other hand, I highly doubt that the elves will allow the thugs from Nighon to roam their lands unhindered. Perhaps I can sic my enemies on each other to make things easier for myself."

I found a stone wrapped in sealskin, with something scrawled on the leather. Puzzled, I picked up the stone and read the message.		It was a note from my longtime lieutenant, Bess, who had stayed in Jadame after I left. Per Bess, the vile halflings had finally come to blows with each other. What gratifying news to hear! I hope they chew out each other's livers, and the armadillos will be happy to gnaw their bones and bury them in the ruins of that stinking hole, Bruton... or whatever their den was called!"
