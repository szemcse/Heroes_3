Erathian history has never recorded the fall of Steadwick to her enemies.  Today we start a glorious campaign to forever change this fact.  No longer will we allow Erathia to hamper our religious and economic ways of life.  We have the element of surprise.  We will soon have victory as well.


A Devilish Plan - Rionpoint

Jobb-kattintásos szöveg:
Before Erathia has a chance to call upon the elves of AvLee for assistance, we have decided to strike at the heart of AvLee's strength - the Gold Dragon Queen. By eliminating the elves' strongest ally, they will be unable to lend aid to Erathia.

Bevezetõ:
A large elvish population inhabits Erathia’s southeastern coast.  Green and gold dragons, native to the region, augment their military strength.  Before we conquer this region, and detour our forces to Steadwick, we must annihilate these dragons.  Our Kreegan allies from Eeofol requested the honor of this mission.  The Kreegans are fierce warriors.  They will enjoy the slaughter.


Groundbreaking - Grainrich

Jobb-kattintásos szöveg:
Our forces will cover most of the distance to the Erathian capitol by using underground tunnels. To maintain the element of surprise, you must attack any Erathian settlement you find. Use the vast network of caves in this area to accomplish this goal.

Bevezetõ:
Reports claim a fleet of Enrothian warships have landed on the southern coast of Erathia. We do not know who commands this force, or its size. Through sources in Eeofol, we know Roland Ironfist cannot lead this fleet. Regardless, our plans remain unchanged.  We start the last phase of our underground invasion and solidify our position along the southeastern coast.  Afterwards, we can transport more reinforcements from Nighon.  We have dug the last tunnels to this area.  You will have the tactical advantage.


Steadwick's Fall - Battlestead

Jobb-kattintásos szöveg:
Assault the Erathian capital of Steadwick. This won't be easy, as the capital is easily and well defended. To make matters worse, the force led by Queen Catherine is on the move. We must capture Steadwick before she arrives!

Bevezetõ:
Catherine Ironfist has enlisted aid from Bracada and AvLee.  She knows we are close to Steadwick.  We must occupy Steadwick before she arrives.  Once we own Erathia's capitol, not even Catherine Ironfist will wrench it from our hands.
