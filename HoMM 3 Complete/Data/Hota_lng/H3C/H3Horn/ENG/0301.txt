Day 1
Üzenet:
I have a strong feeling that this has already happened at some point. Marooned on an unknown island, once again. And once again, I am ship-less. Patris is not around, however... Anyway, the last thing I remember was me being sucked into the vortex when that Casmetra whore snatched the cursed Horn. That vile witch! Neither I, nor... Oh whatever it was that really interested her! The only thing she was after was the Horn of the Abyss! Curses! Nobody escapes the wrath of Jeremy Albatross!		I also lost my high boot. Again. 		Somewhere not far behind loitered a handful of lads that were sucked in with me. Were the rest less lucky, I wonder? I hope not. Bidley was left behind... "Hey rapscals!" I shouted to the flocked men. "We have to get out of here! But first, we need to find out where we are, shiver me timbers!"

Day 2
Üzenet:
Yet again I have a feeling that I relive past events, with an exception of me being on some shallow stinky island. My "Utopia" is probably far away from here. Quite frankly, I have a feeling that we are somewhere at kreegan’s horns. Even the air is different here... We have to find a settlement urgently to replenish the water supplies. 		This is the merriest part of a sea wolf's life: a chance to die of dehydration while surrounded by water. But Jeremy Albatross knows better than to be afraid of such petty threats! I am more inclined to think that perils and difficulty forge pirate's character. Once a book with my biography comes out, it will depict my valor and chivalry as a pirate!

Day 8

A short, dark, cross-eyed man with thin, dark mustache was standing in front of me. I remembered that such tribes lived somewhere in Krewlod and led a nomadic life. I figured out that he was probably a leader here. 	"Who are you?" I asked and squinted. "Name is Timur." He answered.	"And who are you people? What are you doing here?"	"No, who are you!" Exclaimed Timur. "We lived here peacefully, without trouble. You come, kill everyone, destroy fort!" 	"Answer the question!" I bellowed.	"We are refugees. I used to work on plantations." answered the local. 	"What plantation?" I wondered.	"There is a big island to the north," answered my dark friend. "New Steadwick town is there." 		Now I understood where I was, and it did not make me happy.	"New Steadwick!" I screamed with such anger that not only Timur, but my own men cowered in fear, "New Steadwick! You mustache-face... Tell me it's a joke!" I grabbed him by the collar and put my sabre to his throat.	"I swear on blood and honor!" he wailed, sweating bullets. "It is called like that for real!" 	"Hear that, men?" I let poor Timur go and turned to my crew while gesturing, "Sink me! You do realize where we are?!"

Day 9
Üzenet:
Very far away, east of Erathia, there is an archipelago amongst endless sea. We, pirates, call in the Gilbert's isles.  Erathians call it Klondike. Some time ago, during Erathia's prime, they established a fort on the largest isle, that grew into a settlement and later, a full colony.		A soft climate allows growing tobacco, coffee, sugarcane, local exotic fruits and vegetables. Before, the latter was available only in Tatalia. After the death of Gryphonheart, the bond with the metroplex was broken, and the local vice-king feels confident as a ruler of the archipelago. The local pirates challenged him for the control over land, and a war broke out. 		However, all of this is not as important... The important part is that these isles are located terribly far away from the continent! And I have not a single clue where Bidley is and where to set sail.

Day 12
Üzenet:
When we were little, momma used to tell us a tale about the Guiding Star. What’s funny, I used to hear the same tale from pirates and devil knows who else. 		"Jeremy-kan?" A voice rang behind me.		"What?" I turned to Timur. He became a sort of a guide here when he realized that I'm in charge now.		"I don’t want to ask. But why did you set sail to these lands? You fight like a real steppe son. You are a warrior."		"Wa-a-arrior..." I bleated. "I sailed here to sail away. But I don't know where to go, to the extent where I'd need a Guiding Star." 		"Oh, I'd like to sail away too." Smiled Timur. "Light the star and sail wherever the heart desires!"		"Curses. Don't make my life even more miserable." I ruffled up and turned back to the sea.		"But Jeremy-kan! I know how to light it!"

Day 14

I was delightfully enjoying the local mash while sinking into my own thoughts. The mash was made from sugarcane. I wouldn't say that it's amazing, but that will do. Suddenly, Timur entered the cabin, followed by... A thing. Something. If this pile of something knows how to get out of here, I am all ears. Otherwise, I'd shoot it on sight, just in case.				It was a man dressed in some insane robes with feathers and a hat that looked like a bird's head. Dark skin, a large nose, and round, expressionless eyes were seen under the hat.		"This is Crang-Crang." Timur introduced the stranger. "Crang-Crang." Repeated the strange fellow for no reason. "I got it." I replied angrily. "At least not Arbgrh. How can we see the Guiding Star?"		"Grail," said the shaman.		"Grail?" I clarified.		"Grail. Bring Crang-Crang Grail. Light Star! Shine!" 				I pulled Timur by a shoulder to the side.		"What the hell is this? I am utmost surprised it can talk at all.		“Jeremy-kan, this is the priest of the people here. Very Wise! Has some difficulty talking though, yes." 	"Shiver me timbers! Did he seriously mention Grail?" I sighed.		"Yes. We can probably find it if we look at the obelisks. My people told legends that the obelisks depict a map that shows where the Grail is buried." The nomad replied.		"Fine. Take your friend out before everything here absorbs his stench... I'll think about what to do."

I have no idea what the "Grail" is. I don't like to think about strange and irrelevant issues. It's much nicer to think about gold, rum, and women. The fate commands otherwise, however!				And so, the Grail. I heard that those things once fell from Heavens. Nobody really knows what are those, and how many of them exist. But everyone wants one. Well, if Timur is right and the obelisks truly reveal the map, why not search for this Grail? I am ready to sell my last high boot to get out of here and find Bidley. Momma would never forgive if I failed to look after my dear brother.

Day 24
Üzenet:
Looks like I began to remember the stories Patris told me about this place... Curses! He was from here, wasn't he? He escaped when their guerrilla squad was captured and his family imprisoned. Such a pity that Patris is not with me anymore. He would probably have some errands to attend to.

Day 30
Üzenet:
Looks like the local pirates and vice-king got to know about our presence. They clearly dislike the fact that Jeremy Albatross disrupts their plans. Good! I love being feared. Our little fortress is being attacked more and more frequently by those who desire to deal with pirates and colonists. 				The only thing that truly scares me is that our enemies may find Grail before us.

Név:
Day 35
Üzenet:
Timur's men report that a vast cave net is located under the isles. Both monsters and intelligent beings dwell there. I don't have my hopes high about those "intelligent" beings far surpassing our regular "arrrbghs", however. Should we search for Grail there?

Név:
Day 40
Üzenet:
Alarming news have reached me that the caves are inhabited by demons, and not only Tuunbaq. During the First War, the Kreegans have sent and expedition here. However, Catherine was able to defeat Eeofol and Nighon before the expedition arrived. The alliance with Eeofol was broken, and the kreegans were left abandoned in these caves. I doubt that they got any nicer over the time.		Because, you know, you cannot land devil knows where, lose a high boot and not meet Kreegans.

An item sticking out of sand caught my attention. I leaned to examine it... Looks like footwear of some sort! Perplexed, my boys watched me furiously digging something out. A few minutes later, I extracted a pair of posh bright-green boots from the sand. Well-made, but dirty. Couldn't tell if they were designed for men or women. A fancy thing more suited for balls rather than casual roaming... However, I grew tired of walking with a lone high boot on my foot. After shaking off the sand I put one on. The size was a fine match, as if sewn exclusively for me! "Nice boots, Cap'n!" Heehawed one of the crewmen, with the rest joining his jolly gag. I laughed as a response. Then I shrugged and moved onward. Luck smiled upon me today.

You hear deep, repulsive gurgling, and right away a serpent's ugly head arises above the waves. Taken by surprise, a crewman falls over the poop deck railing. While the serpent is enjoying an unexpected snack, you manage to collect yourself and order the gunners to open fire.

You are a stranger here, right? Too convenient! There's a personal matter that I want no one familiar to be aware of. Will you take my offer?
Yoy aren't flying the teal flag. Go away!
I want you to fetch this thing to an acquaintance of mine. His place is eastward from here. Will you?

My friend was going to send me a certain artefact, if he met someone reliable to pass it to. Would it, by chance, be you? The thing in question is a big, rusty horseshoe.
A demon shoe! Exactly what I was looking for. I'm so very grateful you brought it to me. Now, can you pass this thing on to my colleague? His hut is in the middle of the archipelago. He might want you to do something for him as well.

I'm expecting a messenger with a package from my friend, it's meant to be some living plant.
Fascinating! This cloverleaf will perfectly fit my plans! By the way, would you care for a little fetch mission? This thingy here is cursed. There's a geezer living tp the northeast from here, he might know the way to lift the curse.

Your ship made its way calmly. Suddenly, a huge wave rose straight ahead and fell crashing on the deck. – “It's not the sea!” 	You shouted, pulling out your old pistol. 	“It's an ambush!”

You see a company of particularly unfriendly characters emerge from behind a nearby dune. The one in possession of the least appealing face rises something shiny above his head and starts spouting some balderdash. After he seems to have finished, he proceeds to draw steel, and so do his companions.

A long time ago I lost a very precious thing. It may not look like it has much value, but it bears some dear memories. If you were to find and bring it back to me, I'd be very grateful.
My doll! At last! I will once again be able to cast curses! Oh, grand old times are coming back! And to think I had to resort to snake infestations to meddle with my neighbors! It isn't nearly as much fun, and the snakes are growing too big and hard to deal with lately. Will you take them off my hands?
