Jeremy and Alkin have united to defend against the Kreegan attacks on the island. To ensure success, they must capture a secret demon base. It can only be captured once all enemy heroes have been eliminated. Your heroes will be limited to level 18. If Jeremy is defeated, the scenario is lost.

With the swashbucklers and the local inhabitants united, the army marched to the eastern side of the island. We had just enough resources and men to erect a new fortress on our own.	“You've done well, Jeremy Gull,” Alkin praised me. 	“Albatross. It's Albatross,” I corrected indignantly. “What's our next course of action?”	“My tribe has a settlement to the east. I wasn't catching fleas all this time, you know--the fortifications are up. Yours are surely not as good, but then again, you haven't served in the Tatalian army,” Alkin said teasingly.	“That's very impressive, but I have firearms instead of flails and bows,” I shot back, conspicuously revealing my pistol in its holster. 	“All right, all right. We need all the weapons we can get,” he snapped irritably. 	“My scouts have informed me that two Kreegan armies have landed on the northern shore. Luckily, they will have a difficult time advancing through the swamp. In fact, they'll be a perfect target for ambushes and sudden strikes,” I surmised.	“True, but they most certainly have reinforcements elsewhere. And they must have a secret base for these reinforcements, no doubt about it--they'd be unable to proceed with their operations without one. I suggest we find this base and pillage it, if we intend to eliminate a recurring threat. But first things first, as you've mentioned, we need to deal with the immediate threat of these enemy armies on the island. Do you agree with that plan, ally?” Alkin asked, offering me his hand... or paw? I have no idea what they call their limbs.	I shook it, though it felt odd to shake the hand of someone who wasn't human. “Good,” Alkin nodded. “I'll be returning to my army and we'll try to reinforce the settlement even further. The most important thing is to not let the Kreegans gather enough creatures to capture either your fortress or mine. If that happens, it will be the beginning of the end.”

Despite the fact that our new fort was ready, there was no time to stand idle. There were Kreegans all over the island. We'd have to prevent them from reaching their stashes, where they had goods stored away by scouts.	“Patris!” I called my mate.	“Yes, Cap'n?” 	“We need to find and pillage the demons' stashes. Can you handle that?” 	“I'm afraid I wouldn't know where to start,” Patris said, his brow furrowed. 	“That's okay. First, take a few good men and ambush a Kreegan caravan. If you're lucky, that'll lead you to their hideouts.” 	“Ah, yes indeed Cap'n, I have a flair for that kind of thing!” Patris's face lit up. “I'll begin the preparations right away. I'll take Diego and Erik with me; those guys are sharper and braver than most.”	“That's what I like to hear!”

Patris's guerilla activity has proven fruitful. He's managed to rob some Kreegan caravans and has sent the resources to our fortress.

A note from Alkin arrives:	“I suspect that the secret demon base is underground. Every week, hordes of imps emerge from below. They will swarm the island if not stopped. As originally planned, we must continue to focus on defeating the nearby Kreegan armies, and then we must locate their base. My scouts report that they have several devils--the elite Kreegan beasts. Even your blasting powder toy won't save you from those, so be careful, friend.”

Patris reports that he has located and pillaged a demon stash hidden deep in the jungle. Outstanding work! I wonder who he was before he became a pirate.

We've fended off the Kreegans for over a month now. They must not have expected such fierce and organized resistance from savages. Regardless, the hordes of imps continue to advance without any sign of abating. Lately, I've been curious about Alkin. What is a Tatalian sergeant doing on this god-forsaken island? I certainly have to ask--perhaps once this war is over.

An old goblin lives here. He claims that he was once a mighty warrior with fierce attack skills. Recently, his beloved wolf was killed by demons, and he is too frail to avenge her. He offers to pass on everything he knows if we slay the demons for him.
The goblin refuses to speak until his wolf is avenged.
The demons now slain, the old goblin looks elated as he offers to share his knowledge of combat.

A large, mysterious fort lies ahead, decorated by statues of strange lizard-like creatures. Take a risk and look inside? Maybe not?

A group of bandits approaches the fort. They say they once served in an Erathian garrison. In exchange for shelter they are willing to serve in battle if provided with weapons.

A great troll stands before us.		“Hey yous. The pass is no free. Yes, pay now, ten times hundred coins!” he demands, folding his gnarled fingers into a fist. 	“How about one times a sabre between your eyes?” I asked. 	“Hehe!” the troll grinned. “You can do dat. But me is clever. I here, brothers under bridge. If me dying, brothers explode big barrel, and you die with bridge!” 	“You fat racketeer,” I spit, reluctantly handing over the money.

The base is surrounded by a force field. It looks like the staff from one of the Kreegan warchiefs is needed to pass through it.
There is no other way to remove the barrier.
We have the staff! We may remove the force field now.
