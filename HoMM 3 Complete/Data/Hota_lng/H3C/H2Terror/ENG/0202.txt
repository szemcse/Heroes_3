The Kreegans have wonderful ships--slightly lacking on the speed side, but perfect for lengthy journeys. We headed to Erathia: it was pointless to return to Regna now, and fighting the Erathian patrols would seriously endanger us. 	Patris was talking to the new recruits who joined us on the island. I think they were from Utopia's old garrison--or whatever the fort was called before we took it over. Alkin had promised to look after Utopia and hand it back over to me if I ever return. But right now I had to get a new ship, one worthy of a captain by the name of Jeremy Albatross.	My curiosity will ruin me one day. The watchman spotted what looked like land, but I checked the Kreegan map and saw no land there. Interesting, I thought. And that's when the sea devils possessed me to sail closer and drop anchor.

An imposing building hulked in the middle of the island, fenced by pointed stakes. I headed ashore with Patris and a few of my trustiest lads, and found a welcoming party already awaiting us on the beach. Surprisingly, they were women--quite pretty ones, too!		“Shiver me timbers!” I exclaimed as I stepped on shore. “Have I arrived in heaven?” 	“Depends on your definition of heaven,” said one of the women, and took a step forward. “My name is Casmetra. I am the high Hydromancer and the Keeper of the Library.”	“Jeremy Albatross. Regna's army admiral,” I introduced myself, bowing. I heard a choked giggle from somewhere behind me.	“What business brings you to the island, admiral?” asked Casmetra.	Before answering I paused to take a more leisurely look at my new acquaintance. It was hard to determine her age, but she was certainly attractive. I once heard of a captain whose beloved was a mage: they were quite happy together until he found out she was twice his age. Those mages! 	My thoughts were interrupted when a young girl rushed out from behind the tower, shouting. “My lady, we are being attacked again!”	Without much hesitation I ran after the priestesses, and saw a large party of humans, orcs, lizardmen, and undead. Who knows what could unite such a mismatched band, but they were hauling a battering ram with the clear intention of breaching the gates of the fort. Casmetra and her priestesses attacked them with spells, while I, as a true gentleman, shot the orcs carrying the ram with my pistol.		“Boarding, lads!” I yelled, and jumped down from the wall. I rushed to our foes, cutting them down with my sabre. The enemies were clearly unprepared for this sudden strike, and as soon as the few hottest heads had fallen, the attackers retreated. 	“I like you, Jeremy Albatross,” Casmetra said, smiling at me from atop the wall.	“It's just Jeremy,” I replied while sheathing my sabre. 	“You helped without even being asked. Thank you.”	“It's nothing; Jeremy Albatross always protects women and children. I may be a pirate, but I'm an enlightened and compassionate man,” I said modestly.	“If that is so, would you care to help a woman defend her home from bandits?”		Later, over a mug of ale, Casmetra told me that this island is Evenmorn. I'd heard of this place before, in Regna. Necromancers, with the aid of the Moon temple, hope to pillage their secret library, which contains knowledge about water magic and related artifacts. There had been one unsuccessful attack already, but now the necromancers have brought mercenaries from Tatalia and Krewlod. The priestesses alone are no match for such a force. 	If I ever have kids, and they ask me why I took part in this stranger's war, my answer will be, “No idea!”

This tower called Sacredcove stands in a strategically beneficial location, so the necromancers and their allies will attempt to surround us and cut us off from resources. We can import resources from offshore ships for a while, but those won't last long.

Patris was unhappy with my decision. “Cap'n, I know it's not my business, but I don't get why we're helping these...women,” he complained.	“Listen, Patris--there are many benefits to consider. They will be grateful allies, and this Sacredcove may become our auxiliary base. This is why I'm the captain, you know: because I can plan ahead! And that's why you're the first mate,” I explained.	“Whatever you say, Jeremy,” Patris agreed unwillingly, “but I don't like this at all.”	“Why is this crew member insubordinate?” Casmetra asked, appearing out of nowhere and making me jump.	“This is no regular crew member; this is my first mate, Patris,” I answered.	“Most pleased,” replied priestess coldly, and introduced herself: “Casmetra, the High Hydromancer.”	“Good day to you, milady,” replied Patris with a grin, and sauntered away with his limping walk.	“You should be stricter about the hierarchy under your command,” reproved the priestess.	“Don't be such a bore. We pirates are brothers to each other! It all builds on mutual respect,” I blustered, knowing perfectly well that Regna is full of crews and captains who look like bands of ogres from Ravage Roaming in Jadame.	“You are no good at lying,” Casmetra sighed, and disappeared in a magical flash.	“A poor liar, a poor commander...I'm a pathetic loser, it seems,” I muttered to myself.

The first supplies have arrived from the ships. I hope the necromancers don't have a powerful enough fleet to threaten my ships, so the supply chain won't be broken.

Today I decided to send a message to my beloved brother Bidley. Inspired by some rum, I started on the letter. My thoughts refused to coalesce into anything comprehensible for some time. I tortured the pen for about an hour, and eventually ended up with this: 	“I have some problems. Your dear brother J.”

A new supply shipment has arrived from the fleet. Diego sent a message about a storm approaching the island; they may have to find a new place to drop anchor. Bloody hell! That means the supplies will stop coming soon.

Large black storm clouds are approaching the island. Looks like Diego was right. I hope they find a place where they'll be safe from both the storm and the mercenaries.

I was about to go to bed when Patris appeared with a report. “Cap'n, I did some scouting and found that the enemy has three fortresses. There is also a Nighon colony underground--looks like it was built during the war, but abandoned afterwards. We might try to make those underground monsters serve our cause. If we don't, the enemy will use them.”	I could hardly contain my delight. 	“You never cease to impress me, Patris. Did you used to be an AvLee ranger or something?”	“No, Cap'n,” my first mate said wryly. “I don't like to talk about it.” 	“Oh come on, we're all friends here. Crewmates shouldn't have secrets between them.”	“If you want,” Patris relented. “I'm from an archipelago far to the east. There's an Erathian colony there, and I was one of the men who fought for independence. So sneaking like a rat through swamps and forests is natural for me.”	“Was your fight successful?” I asked.	“The governor caught everyone in our movement--except me. I was hired on a ship sailing to Erathia in the morning, so I escaped. Everyone else was hung. Since then, I swore never to go back home,” Patris concluded, anguish in his voice.	“Why didn't you swear to take revenge?” I exclaimed.	“What can a solitary middle-aged man do? I have no riches, nor any skill in persuasion, nor any skill in magic. Besides, my wife and daughter are there. I hope no harm has come to them. My daughter must be grown already, probably married, and doesn't even know who her father was.”	“What if I promise you that we'll return there and bring justice to your people? We'll send that governor swimming with the sharks, and establish you as the new king, or whatever you would like to be,” I offered, smiling.	Patris's face went pale and he was silent for a long moment. But after some hesitation, he replied quietly, “That would be the greatest gift you could give me, Cap'n.”
