Terror or the Seas

Leírás:
The mysterious Horn of the Abyss was hiding from the eyes of the mortals for too long. Sooner or later, somebody would desire it. Is it a chain of consequences or a random chance?  Hard to say. Jeremy and Bidley do not yet realize what adventure awaits them with their desire to get the Horn.

As soon as Bidley, after all his dungeon adventures reached for the Horn, the voice behind yelled:	'Unbelievable! It is mine, finally!'		After that, Bidley's new partner Dargem landed a blow at his head, and grabbed the artifact. The walls of the ancient vault started to shake, and the altar rose up, forming an island. The traitor grabbed the Horn, but did not figure out how to use it.  Dargem summoned a boat and jumped in rapidly, taking the unconscious Bidley with him.		Jeremy and Casmetra saw the birth of a new island. They also saw how Dargem sail away, and great sea serpents emerge from the depths after him. Jeremy did not know what was going on, but he was sure that his brother is in trouble.

Utószó:
The defenders of the Regnan fortress have shivered, and Casmetra and Jeremy hurried in. Dargem left the captive be and grabbed the Horn. He ran to the highest tower. While Jeremy was helping his brother to untie the ropes, Casmetra yelled powerfully:	'Give the Horn back! Immediately!'	With a scared face, Dargem yelled back:	'Never! You betrayed me, and left me alone! Now I know what to do!'		Taking the artifact in both hands, Dargem was just about to blow the Horn, when with a piercing 'STOP!!!' Casmetra threw a magical spell at him. A huge magical explosion followed, and the shock wave destroyed half of a fortress, creating something like a whirlpool underneath it.		The only thing that Jeremy remembered was how he tried to get to higher ground desperately, and how Casmetra yelled:	'Idiot! We will be dragged into another Plane of existence because of you!'		Hours, or maybe weeks after that, Jeremy found himself on a sea shore. Where is Bidley? And what happened to the Horn? May this be the end of the legend about the Horn of the Abyss?

A quick glance, a misplaced word, a reckless decision… All these things can change our life radically. Through taking the decision to help the woman, Jeremy has changed his and his brother's life dramatically. It is hard to predict who will be our friend, and who will be our foe. It is as hard as to predict the moments when our life will change.  Jeremy stepped on this thin ice since his war with the demons on the small island. So far, he assumed the events around him to be resolved by his luck.


Prisoner of Doom - Csatahely

Bevezetõ:
In the bards' legends, almost everything starts with a hero sitting in a tavern. Bidley the pirate was doing just the same. The place located in a fishing town on a shore of a barbaric Krewlod.		Who knew that a gossip with a drunkard will turn into a great adventure that will change the world? Nobody, of course. And definitely not Bidley. He was sitting and drinking cheap beer, listening to an old pirate tale about a prisoner who was said to be kept in a magical prison. Bidley thought that it was probably some powerful mage, probably from Bracada. He also thought that the generosity of such prisoner should be, well, generous.		Unfortunately, Bidley was not aware of the existence of Xanthor, the well-known mage. Xanthor was not fond of pirates at all. The fate, however, sent Bidley to rescue his old nemesis. And this was the beginning...

Bevezetõ:
Bidley got to know about the Horn of the Abyss after saving Xanthor. In reality, Xanthor told him about it in hope that the pirate will vanish, trying to acquire it.  Bidley will never know this, however.		Now, reunited with the brother, they started plotting the march for the Horn of the Abyss with all seriousness. They needed ships, many ships, men and supplies as well. Where to get all of that from? Casmetra offered to explore the Hell Shore, and raid the Kreegan lands. A dangerous venture, but a promising one.
