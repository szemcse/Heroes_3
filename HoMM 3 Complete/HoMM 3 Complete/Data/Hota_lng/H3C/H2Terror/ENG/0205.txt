Üzenet:
It was a good idea to make proper preparations before going for the Horn. The pirates' path ran south of Tatalia, toward a group of unknown islands. Either it was a coincidence, or somebody was spying on them, but they encountered Tatalia's royal fleet in their way: two frigates and almost a dozen smaller vessels. The smaller ships were easy to sink, but as soon as frigates approached it was clear that they had to withdraw. Bidley's caravel gave one last volley and, propelled by a tailwind, started to flank the dangerous corner. Jeremy was right behind, followed by the galleys. However, the Tatalian frigates pursued, tearing their sails with shrapnel in hopes of stopping the daring pirates. One of the enemy ships caught up and began sinking the galleys. Lizardmen with daggers in the teeth leapt into the water and climbed on board to head for the sails, turning the deck into a bloodbath.	Eventually only one galley was left: Patris's. This was the first time he had taken charge of a vessel as a captain. 	“We have to stop the Tatalians immediately,” said Casmetra with a determined voice. “With magic.”	“Won't you hurt Patris's galley?” Jeremy asked in alarm.	“I don't know. What happens happens,” answered the priestess.	“Wait, we cannot risk his life!” cried Jeremy.	But Casmetra wasn't listening. With an elegant gesture, she wove a destructive spell that summoned icebergs from the water. They grew rapidly, destroying everything in their way. Chunks of ice and wood rained down on the pirates' fleet. The Tatalian frigate was damaged, and the galley was torn apart, impaled on a rising spike of ice.	When the destruction was over, Casmetra left for her cabin. Jeremy stood for a while, looking at the now-receding monstrous iceberg that had saved his life, but taken the life of his friend. As a pirate, he had always known that sooner or later he would lose his first mate and his other close friends. That's the risk of being a pirate. But he didn't expect it to happen today.

After heavy losses of ships and crew, Bidley's crippled fleet arrived at the place marked by Xanthor. It was an insignificant little island encircled by craggy mountains. The words “Island of the Vengeful Serpent” had been scribbled by an unknown traveler's hand onto one of the stones sticking out of the water.	“I don't see any Horn here,” observed Jeremy.	“Of course not, my friend! The Horn is inside the serpent's labyrinth, which is located underground. And only I know how to get there!” announced Casmetra, and after taking a step forward she spread her hands wide and began to cast a spell.	The priestess's words turned into blazing numbers and letters that flew toward the mountain and disappeared into it. When she finally went silent, the mountains let out a roar and a voice like the clanging of hammer on anvil sounded:	“Password approved. Opening the passage.”	“What was that?” asked Bidley in fear.	“I don't know,” shrugged Casmetra. “They say that the Oracle of Enroth sounds sort of like that.”	“A thousand devils! This is...indescribable!” exclaimed Jeremy.		An ominous black passage opened between the mountains. A stone ladder was visible inside, its end lost in the darkness. Bidley took a pistol in one hand and a sabre in the other.	“We have to be extremely cautious,” warned the priestess. “There are plenty of traps and illusions below.”		Bidley nodded, and with a band of trusty sea dogs he started to descend into the darkness. Just as Jeremy and Casmetra were about to follow him, the iron voice boomed:	“Second level of protection negated. Terminating access.”		The last pirate was just about to turn around and jump out, but the mountains sealed back up right in front of his nose. Jeremy frantically punched and kicked at the mountain face, but nothing could open the passage again. Casmetra tried her spell once more, but this time it didn't work.		“Damnation! I lost my first mate and my brother at the same time!” shouted Jeremy, slicing his palm open with his sabre in his rage.	“Calm down! Your brother is alive. He is inside the labyrinth. Whether he gets out or not depends on him!” said Casmetra, resting her hand on Jeremy's shoulder.	“Oh that's just great. And what do you plan to do now?” asked Jeremy maliciously, without turning around. 	“Return to camp and wait for Bidley. I'm sure he'll be all right.”

Bidley ended up in a series of damp caves with a small group of men. Strangely enough, the place was not as dark as it had looked at first, because the caverns were lit by an odd bluish glow.	“Where to, Cap'n?” one of the sea dogs asked. 	“Onward,” answered Bidley. “We're leaving this place with the Horn, or we ain't leaving it at all. I trust that fate hasn't given up on us.”

Casmetra was gazing into a magical globe. Jeremy, seeing this, walked around her to try to look inside. 	“Careful! You'll turn into a frog!” said the priestess.	“Seriously?” Jeremy exclaimed, jumping backwards. 	“No, just joking. But the frogs are still around.”	“What?” the pirate asked in confusion.	“Tatalians,” explained Casmetra. “Their fleet has retreated, but they're repairing their ships. The soldiers are on the shore, recuperating. Soon they'll gather the courage to search for us again, and they'll try to destroy us. They probably think that Regna has decided to raid Tatalia.” 	“We have to hold them back somehow,” said Jeremy. “Otherwise, Bidley will end up in those frogs' hands.”

I summoned my courage to call Casmetra into my cabin. The priestess entered the room, her gown swishing softly, and gave me an inquisitive look. I looked her directly in the eyes. “Casmetra, I have this suspicion that you could have cast that spell without harming Patris's galley.” 	“What makes you think that?” Casmetra asked, looking surprised. “Such spells are not easy to control. They're like your pistol: you can't be sure exactly where the bullet will fly, can you?”	“Patris was there. I noticed the conflict between you and him,” I insisted.	“What? Do you honestly believe that I would doom my own apprentices and a handful of excellent soldiers just because of one grumpy old man?” Casmetra stamped her foot on the ground, eyes flashing. 	“I...I'm sorry, I hadn't thought about that,” I replied and sat down on the bed, totally confused. “It's just...I keep going around and around this. Patris is dead. My brother is stuck in the underworld, and gods only know whether he'll make out of there alive. I've been getting drunk every night just to get some sleep.”	Casmetra smiled softly, and approached me. “You are tired, Jeremy. You need to take a break,” she said, caressing me with her slender hands. I must admit, her fragrance was most pleasing. 	“Indeed, some rest is a good idea,” I smiled.

I have been thinking about Patris and his home on that far-off island--that home he'll never return to. It's possible someone survived that crash, but the chances are pretty slim. One day I will visit that archipelago, and find Patris's wife and daughter--or avenge them, if the local governor harmed them in any way. We pirates always carry out the last wish of the dead.

Bidley approached the walls of a dilapidated prison, built from what looked like the wreckage of ships. A voice came through the door: “Hey, buddy! Save me!”	“I'm not your buddy,” answered Bidley calmly. “First, tell me who you are, and what you're doing here.”	“My name is Dargem. I'm just a mage who was in the wrong place at the wrong time.” 	“Aren't those your manuscripts that I've been finding scattered around all the way here?” asked the pirate. 	“My diary? And I was wondering where it went! I was caught by some of the crazed pirates that roam here,” the prisoner replied.	“Were you after the Horn of the Abyss?” Bidley demanded.	“Yes. And so are you, I assume--no one comes here for the fresh air.”	“And why would I let a competitor out?”	“Wait!” begged Dargem. “Let me out! I'm no competitor to you! I don't need the Horn, not anymore! Take it for yourself, and do whatever you want with it! Blow it, drink rum from it, I don't care. But without me you won't be able to pass the illusions.”	“What illusions?” Bidley asked with alarm, stepping closer to the door. 	“Some of the sea serpents you'll see aren't real. But you won't be able to tell the real ones from the fake ones without the magical spell I have,” explained the prisoner.	“All right, let's go. You've convinced me.”
