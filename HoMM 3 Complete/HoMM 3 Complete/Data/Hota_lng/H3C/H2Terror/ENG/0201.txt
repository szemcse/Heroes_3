Bidley disliked the shores of Krewlod--the stench of dirty orc and goblin bodies, their mumbo-jumbo tongue, their complete lack of any culture, their preference for brute force as the solution to any problem. He preferred the songs of Erathian bards, the artwork of elven artisans, and the wines of Jadame. He had all of that back at home in Regna--contrary to the common prejudice which took pirates to be nearly barbarians. It is true that there are plenty of low-brow types among the young and the foolish, and plenty of his people who would easily be accepted in a company of Krewlod swashbucklers. But there are also plenty of intelligent and civilized people among the captains and admirals.	Bidley left the Shark Chowder Inn, musing. If that drunkard was right and the barbarians had truly captured such a powerful wizard, then the Bracada sorcerers would be very happy if he was rescued. And this would mean that the pirates could not only expect a generous reward, but could also win the right to pillage ships near the shores of Bracada--so long as they didn't hurt the wizards, of course. It was worth a shot.	The barbarians were currently holding their Festival of Life. As a Regna native, Bidley could never really understand the celebration. Duke Boragus was dead, and the even crueler and shrewder young barbarian lord Kilgor was taking his place. Krewlod was always on the edge of anarchy, but right now it was closer than usual. Bidley's fleet was far away, but he didn't have much need of it. Instead, he would gather some bold local fellows, capture one of the closest Krewlod forts, and assault Zargand from there. The motley tribes were busy cutting each other down for no reason at all; for a few coins, they'd be happy to attack whoever he told them to.	Bidley stopped a passerby, clearly not a local.	“Hey fella, where's the closest Krewlod army fort?”	“Straight north by the road,” answered the stranger laconically as he continued his journey.

All in all, Bidley thought, he needed to hurry up. Sooner or later the news of their actions would reach the earwax-clogged heads of the local lords, and they would attempt to roust their unwelcome guests out of the area. But swift and determined actions would force those lords to surrender and to assist him in besieging Zargand. Of course, once Kilgor's henchmen arrive, anyone who had helped him would be executed--but these barbarians are so unprincipled, they're bound to pay for it sooner or later anyways.

Day 8
Üzenet:
Scouts report that Krewlod's army holds multiple forts. One is located to the southwest, and the other to the northeast. The magical prison is in the northwest, but it would be foolish to approach it without a powerful army. One should also remember that this prison negates all magic.

Day 11
Üzenet:
Bidley had a strange dream last night. He dreamed that he was sailing across the sea, and could see through the water as clearly and distinctly as if he was looking over the horizon. He could also breathe underwater. What could this mean? Were these his nostalgic memories of the seas? Or was it merely a dream?

Day 18
Üzenet:
A crewman ran to find Bidley in the morning, handing him a letter that had arrived late last night. The pirate was quite surprised--who would send him a letter? But after unwrapping the parchment, he recognized the familiar handwriting. It included only the following message:	 “I have some problems. Your dear brother J.”

A priest lives here. He tells you about a pack of troublesome mummies. He doesn't have the strength to expel them himself, so he asks you to destroy the foul creatures.
Mummies are located to the east of the priest's house. Kill them and return.
The priest is grateful to be rid of the undead. He promises to share his knowledge with you.

Bidley notices the traces of numerous wagons: the fort must be close. The only thing left is to catch the guards by surprise.

A band of corsairs is hiding here. Their leader is Jabarkas, son of the late Duke Boragus. Now Jabarkas flies into wild rages all the time because of his father's death. The corsairs would like to find a new leader, but only if their old leader is defeated.
Jabarkas is still alive and wandering around somewhere.
Jabarkas's army was defeated and he has been put to shame; he won't show his face again for some time. Are you ready to accept the corsairs into your army?

Two sorceresses live here. They agree to join the army and back you up with spells--for a small fee, of course.
They require 5 gems and 2000 gold, no less.
Excellent! The sorceresses are ready to join your forces.
